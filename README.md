# Sass Tutorial

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) stands for "syntactically awesome stylesheets". It adds variables, loops, inheritance and many other extras to CSS.

## To get started using Sass

1. Windows users will need to download [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/) by clicking on the download link on the page.

2. Windows and Mac users will run `gem install sass` in terminal or command line. If that doesn't work `sudo gem install sass`.

3. Linux users run `sudo su -c "gem install sass"`.

3. Sublime users need to install Sass from Sublime Packages, since Sublime does not automatically have syntax highlighting.
